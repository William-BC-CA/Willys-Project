                <td>Favourite Aspects: Nice hover effect. Like the dropdown menu also. The GIF for the footer logo appears to be very cool. The footer formatting appears to be somewhat neat.<br>
                    Suggestions: The navigation could be more organized and well formatted in contrast to websites like Yahoo. Wouldâ€™ve been better if the website had perhaps more colours, specifically bright colours, instead of the generic black and white with yellow and red, which to me looks a little old-fashioned and industrial.</td>

                    Suggestions: The subpages while hovering could be placed better, would like the header photo to be more to the center.

                    Suggestions: Background should be fixed, maybe use another video instead of the Sparky video, content feels a little lacking as there were only 3 pages, minor grammatical mistakes should be fixed.</td
