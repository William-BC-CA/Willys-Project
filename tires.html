                <td>Look no further, especially if you're looking for a high-performance tire.
                    This model of tire has been the segment leader among ultra high performance tires.
                    Not only does the tire provide extreme levels of grip compared to other tires, they are very balanced.
                    They perform well in both dry and wet conditions, offer good road noise and comfort and are very reliable.
                    They've also been used as factory tires on a variety of performance cars such as a BMW M3.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>2. Bridgestone Potenza S-04 Pole Position</th>
                <td>This model is another tire that offers extreme levels of grip and performs great in both dry and wet conditions. 
                    Unfortunately, they are way heavier than the Michelin Super Sport but does offer similar levels of performance.
                    One user was able to get roughly three summers out of the tires driving a 2014 Mini Roadster, which demonstrates its decent tread life.
                    It is not recommend to be using these tires when the temperatures start to fall. 
                    Heat is a factor that makes performances tires working well or else your grip levels will fall sharply.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>3. Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2</th>
                <td>These tires are the factory tires on some of the world's fastest cars, including the Porsche 911 GT2 RS that holds a lap record on the Nurburgring, a german race track.
                    Porsche never messes around when it comes to performance, so you know that you can trust these tires.
                    These tires work extremely well with immense amounts of grip in the dry but the manufacturer does not suggest driving with them during wet conditions. 
                    If you have a high-performance vehicle that you use on track, it's hard to go wrong with the Pilot Sport Cup 2s.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>4. Yokohama Advan Neova AD08 R</th>
                <td>These tires are also designed to offer high levels of grip in both wet and dry driving scenarios.
                    Unfortunately, the aggressive tread on these tires can produce some loud road noise, but as a trade-off, they provide high levels of grip thanks to their soft, sticky compound.
                    The AD08 Rs are promising if you want to turn in fast lap after fast lap over multiple sessions during a track day.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>5. Hankook Ventus R-S4</th>
                <td>Truly a successor to the Hankook Ventus R-S3, these tires deliver excellent handling and cornering performance. 
                    It is all thanks to its massive outboard shoulder blocks.
                    A massive, continuous center rib contributes to quick steering response.
                    The tire also improves on the R-S3's issues regarding wet grip through highly dispersible silica, a material that belongs to the tire, but they are not ideal to be used in heavy rain.
                    These tires can take advantage of the extra reinforcement in the shoulder to handle performance driving, even on vehicles with high camber.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>6. Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R</th>
                <td>These tires are a road-going semi-slick tire suited to track usage only.
                    They will wear out quickly on the street, so if you go for these soft and sticky tires, you may want to get a second set of wheels as your "track only" wheel and tire set.
                    These tires will provide extremely good dry traction, but might be traded-off for some steering feel due to their extreme levels of grip. They are very loud on the road.
                    They may be one of the best high-performance tires on the market today (they are also used on the Nurburgring record with the Lamborghini Aventador SV J).
                    However, they won't perform well on the road, noisy, and have lowe wet weather grip.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>7. Toyo Proxes R888 R</th>
                <td>These tires are sometimes viewed as an alternative to the Pirelli Trofeo R, with a similarly soft compound and aggressive tread.
                    They are also best suited on a dry track. They have low levels of wet weather grip and has a high road noise, which makes them a good tire to put on your car when you get to the track and take off before you leave.
                    They are safe to drive on the road with but it's simply not ideal.
                    These tires are extremely durable for an ultra high-performance tire and competitively priced.</td>
