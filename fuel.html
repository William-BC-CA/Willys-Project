        <h2>Types of Fuel</h2>
        <p>Here are the current types of fuel used in vehicles:</p>

        <h3><strong>A Brief Summary Of Gasoline</strong></h3>
        <p>Gasoline is a very common type of fuel. It is used in almost everyday vehicles. 
            According to the US they consume about 400 million gallons of gasoline a day which leads to 20 million barrels of oil a day. 
            Apparently, half of the oil is only used for gasoline. 
            Oil consumption world-wide would be about 28 million barrels of oil per year, which is expected to grow to about 44 billion barrels per year around 2025.
            Conventional oil reserves that are known woud be about 1000 billion barrels, which is estimated to have 300 to 1000 billion barrels of oil yet to be discovered. 
            It is confirmed that the oil could potentially last well past 2060, probably into 2090.<br><br>Source: <a href = "https://motorcycleinfo.calsci.com/Gasoline.html">calsci.com</a></p>

        <h3><strong>A Summary of Electricity in Vehicles</strong></h3>
        <p>It appears that electric vehicles are becoming more and more popular as consumers believe that using electricity would be more efficient and cheaper than conventional gasoline. 
            Not only that, electric vehicles can have immense amounts of acceleration due to electricity giving the vehicle instant power, considering that it doesn't need a 6 speed or 8 speed gearbox.
            There is also a special set of vehicles that uses BOTH gasoline and electricity to power themselves together, known as "hybrids." They simply use gasoline to conserve electricity into a separate battery which would be used when it's ready.
            Certain cars would use it to maintain speed using very low acceleration by propelling the rear wheels and would instantly kick to gasoline or both when acceleration is greatly needed.
            Some can also be "plug-in hybrids" where it would require a charge of electricity and be used instantly as gasoline would pick it back up when the charge has been depleted. It would then continue the journey as what a hybrid would do. 
            Electric or hybrid vehicles aren't easy to obtain as they can be very expensive or more expensive than their gasoline counterparts. The decision is totally up to the consumer in terms of making the decision.<br><br>

        <h3><strong>A Summary of Diesel in Vehicles</strong></h3>
        <p>Diesel fuel has been mostly available at a nearby gas station. They provide their own benefits. Sometimes, they could be cheaper than conventional gasoline or more expensive depending on the level of difficulty or the price it takes to make the diesel fuel.
            U.S. petroleum refineries produce around 11 to 12 gallons of diesel fuel from each 42-gallon barrel of crude oil. 
            Back in around 2006, most of the diesel that are sold in U.S. contained high amounts of sulphur, which produce emissions that are harmful to human health. 
            The Environmental Protection Agency has created a measure to reduce the sulphur content of diesel fuel sold in the U.S.
            The requirements have been changed over time, commencing with diesel fuel sold for vehicles used on roadways. 
            Diesel fuel that are now sold in the U.S for on-highway use is ultra-low sulfur diesel, with 15 parts per million of sulphur. 
            Most freight and delivery trucks such as trains, buses, boats, use diesel engines. 
            Certain cars and small trucks can also have diesel engines (similar to the Audi S5 in the photo). 
            They could also be used to generate electricity.
            In 2019, distillate fuel (known as diesel fuel) consumption by the U.S. transportation sector was about 47.2 billion gallons (1.1 billion barrels).
            This has accounted for 15% of the total U.S. petroleum consumption and about 23% of the total energy consumption by the transportation sector.<br><br>Source: <a href = "https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/diesel-fuel/">Eia.gov</a></p>

        <h3><strong>A Brief Summary of Hydrogen in Vehicles</strong></h3>
        <p>A hydrogen vehicle is a type of alternative fuel vehicle that uses hydrogen fuel for motive power. Hydrogen Vehicles consists of hydrogen-fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles.
            Power is generated by using chemical energy of hydrogen and transferring it to mechanical energy, by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to power electric motors or by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine.<br><br>Source: <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle">Wikipedia</a></p>
