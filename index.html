        <h2>A Brief History on Cars</h2>
        <p>Also known as automobiles, they were first invented and perfected in Germany and France within the late 1800s. It was then that the Americans quickly in an attempt to dominate the automotive industry in the first half of the 20th century. Henry Ford was able to innovate mass-production techniques which lead to becoming a standard. Ford, along with General Motors and Chrysler became the "Big Three" auto companies in around the 1920s. Manufacturers transmitted their resources to the military in around World War II. After that, automobile production in Europe and Japan soared up to meet the growing demand. Once crucial to the expansion of American urban centres, it was there that the industry had become a shared global enterprise with the rise of Japan as one of the top automakers by 1980.<br><br>Source: <a href = "https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/automobiles">history.com</a></p>
