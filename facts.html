                    During the 1830s, Robert Anderson from Scotland, whose motorized carriage was built sometime between 1832 and '39. 
                    Batteries consisted of galvanic cells which were not yet rechargeable, which made to look more of a parlor trick.
                    However, Robert Davidson of Aberdeen, built a prototype electric locomotive back in 1837.
                    A bigger and better version which was later demonstrated in 1841, was able to reach about 2.4 kilometers at 6.4 km/h towing about six tons of cargo. 
                    Apparently, it would run to the point where it needed new batteries. The performance was however so alarmed that railway workers (having seen it as a threat) decided to destroy Davidson's devil machine, which he'd later called Galvani.</td>

                    These features can release volatile organic compounds, which produce the familiar smell. 
                    Some have rumored them to be toxic.
                    Over the years, numerous people have wondered whether or not the chemicals that cause the new car smell are toxic and hazardous to human health.
                    <br>From an American standpoint, "these chemicals can be harmful when inhaled or ingested and may lead to severe health impacts such as birth defects, learning disabilities and cancer. 
                    Since the average American spends more than 1.5 hours in a car every day, toxic chemical exposure inside vehicles is becoming a major source of potential indoor air pollution." 
                    This isn't really a major problem but rather something that can be removed by simply buying a used car as the odor would start to fade dramatically over time.</td>

                    A simple Google search shows that it takes about 384,400 kilometers to reach the Moon from the Earth, which is around 10 times the circumference of the Earth.
                    The only catch is that air is lacking, thus making one unable to breathe and the car unable to burn the petrol.</td>

                    However, China has surpassed the United States as one of the nations with the most vehicles, which numbered up to 300.3 million as of April 2017.
                    Apparently, United States is still the largest vehicle population in the world, along with 239.8 million cars, the Ward's study reported.
                    The amount of cars being driven will have to come at a cost as a vehicle population of 2 billion would require the world to produce at least 120 million barrels of oil per day, which leads up to about 87 million today, excluding electric vehicles.</td>

                    Thieves can also strip parts and sell them to shops and junkyards. Unfortunately, they mostly target the older models due to their lack of security and advanced anti-theft production that newer cars have.</td>

                    When the driver pulled over, he lied about how the speedo is faulty.
